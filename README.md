## TachiSY RPC*

> \**name is subject to change*

An android app built in in 100% Kotlin to set up your discord rich presence *(using the [KizzyRPC](https://github.com/dead8309/KizzyRPC) library)* based on what Manga/Anime/LN you are seeing using the (4) available pre-defined templates!.

> *FYI, this app was made purely for my own needs and to learn to code (this was my first app) but open-sourced it in the end so that it can be of use to those who need it. If you have a thing or two to point out to me related to the code, then feel free to do so.*

### What are the (4) available templates?

### Will More templates or custom template be added?

> **More Templates—** Sure!! just open a new issue for it and I'll add a new template with your requested app asap!

> **Custom Template—** No... well at least not for now.
> There are other android rich presence apps you can use for custom rich presence, but if you really think it would be a good idea to add it, then let me know in a new Issue! (adding custom template is not hard at all.. It's just that I'm too lazy lol!!)

### Can I set the Manga/Anime/LN's cover page as the large image in my rich presence?
> Well, I could always just add an option to set the LargeImage  using a img link provided by the user, but I'm trying to find a way to automatically grab the image from the (4) apps, so I dont plan on adding such a feature until requested in an Issue.
